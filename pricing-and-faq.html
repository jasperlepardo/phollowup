                  While most of our users prefer sending reminders using their own business cell phone number, it is possible to use PhollowUp’s SMS reminders without providing a cell phone line. You will need to purchase SMS credits from inside the “Subscription” panel. Price varies per country. Alternatively, you could send the reminders by Email instead, at no additional cost.

                  No, because Apple doesn’t support third-party message sending at the moment (iPhone apps can’t send SMS in the background). If your business currently uses an iPhone, we can provide you a basic Android phone for free when you avail any of our yearly subscriptions.

                  What sets PhollowUp aside from any other calendar system is the level of automation it can bring to your business. We accomplish that by automatically sending multiple SMS (or Emails) to your customers at different steps in their journey. They don’t require any work on your end— simply log your appointments and walk-ins inside your calendar and we take care of all the rest!

                  Yes. If ever you decide that PhollowUp isn’t the best solution for your business, simply cancel your account from your “Subscription” panel. If you are an existing user considering to cancel your account at the moment, we would politely ask for one favor: we are still a young company and would like to know how to avoid repeating the mistakes which lost your trust. Please share the reason for your cancellation to support@phollowup.com, it will help us greatly. We wish you the best.
